 THEM: the balls are the only points for you ? they are for me
 YOU: the balls are the only ones of value , the hats also are mininally valued . however , you originally asked to take the book - so i'm assuming the balls are not your only item of any value . i'm fine with splitting the points up if we're not going to agree .
 THEM: the balls are my only points . i was simply trying to negotiate
 YOU: alright , so in that case ; will you concede to earning 5 points each by splitting the balls as i had originally suggested or waste our time here tonight ? : )
