<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>

    <li style="color:#FF0000">Please do <b>not</b> state facts about the apartment or about the terms of the lease that are not explicitly given to you. It's okay to embellish certain aspects as a negotiation tactic!
    <li> <b>To the landlord</b>:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The tenant cannot see all properties of the apartment and may ask you questions about them.</li>
            <li>It's okay to embellish facts, but don't make up new properties not provided to you (or contradict given properties).</li>
            <li style="color:#009933"> <b>Do:</b> this neighborhood is really beautiful, the neighbors are all really friendly</li>
            <li style="color:#FF0000"> <b>Don't do:</b> (if "no parking" is given) I'd be happy to give you a parking spot if you can pay $50 more.</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
    <li> <b>To the tenant</b>:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If a property is marked with "?", it means that its value is unknown to you, but you can ask the landlord about it.</li>
            <li>It's okay to make up preferences as a negotiation tactic, but don't make up properties that are not provided (or contradict given properties).</li>
            <li style="color:#009933"> <b>Do:</b> It is next to a highway and seems like it can get quite noisy. </li>
            <li style="color:#FF0000"> <b>Don't do:</b> (if the facts did not mention a broken window) The window is broken. </li>
        </ul>
     </li>
</ul>
